# Name: Bored Bot 
### What problem are we solving?
People are bored most of the time, thus we aim to give users creative ideas to do with there time. 

### Who/ what does the project interface with (people, other systems, hardware)?
This project interfaces with people along with the bored API. 

### What are the inputs?
The user answers a series of questions that help our code determine the best activity for that person. 

### What are the outputs?
An activity based on the preferences of the user.

### List the 5 steps to go from input -> output
* First we will filter the data based on the attributes they care about the most: Type, Price Range, Accessibility, Participants.
* Giving the user the option to stay or change between categories  
* It lists 5 activities the user can chose from.
* Once the user picks a suggested activity, we provide them with further information. 
* If the user finds no suggestion or wants to stop, we give them our goodbyes and good luck. 

### What's the biggest risk?
* Not having enough time
* The amount of data we have access to 

### How will you know you're successful?
* The program provides good outputs based on user input. 
* The program does not crash and handles unexpected inputs.
